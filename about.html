                    <p class="text">Mariah Brown-Tullis is the proud owner and CEO of Locs and Lashes Beauty Salon.  Channeling her love of 
                    nails and hair from youth, she decided to pursue a career in Cosmetology and received licensing from
                    Ridge Technical College in Winter Haven, FL.  Graduating from South Florida with a B.S. in Graphic Design,
                    Mariah enhances the branding of Locs and Lashes through web-design and marketing.  Along with her love for
                    cosmetology, Mariah also loves fellowshipping with women and believes in the power of female 
                    encouragement. In addition to beautifying women, Locs and Lashes Salon is a place where women unify and
                    build one another.  The goal of the salon is to make women beautiful, focusing on making them feel 
                    as beautiful on the outside as they are on the inside.</p>
